This app handled more than fifteen trillion dollars of transactions last year, that's more than **MasterCard** and an amount of money that similar to European Union's GDP.

It also has more that nine hundred million users in China. People use Alipay on buses and taxies, to pay their utility bills, to shop in stores and online, and even to buy insurance and make investments.

And yet many Americans may have never heard of it.

"And it's huge in China, the Alipay app is essentially a financial supermarket that **allows** you to do everything on your mobile phone."

Alipay's parent company AntGroup is getting global attention in 2020. 

Its combined IPOs in Hong Kong and Shanghai could be one of the largest **listings** ever, as Ant's aiming for a market **valuation**  **in excess of** two hundred billion dollars. 

That means it may **sell** more than twenty billion dollars in shares when it goes to public.

So what is Ant and how did it become so big? 

It all started with Jack Ma, the **flamboyant** Chinese bussinessman who's known for his **inspirational** speeches,  **extravagant** performances at company parties, and of course, co-founding Alibaba more than two **decades** ago, which has since became a half trillion dollar online shopping giant.

"Alibaba is like a mix of Amazon, eBay and Paypal, also with **a dash of** Google. But it handles more bussiness, its shopping sites than any other companies in the world".

When Alibaba's just starting out, it created Alipay as an **escrow** serivce to hold money from buyers and release the **funds to** sellers after the goods **had been sent and** received.

This built trust between **merchants** and buyers, and helped to pave the way for eCommerce industry **boom** in China.

Not that many people in China have credit cards compared to the US. With Alipay, most people **draw funds** directly from their **bank** accounts, and make cashless electronic payments, without needing to use credit cards.

"In China you barely see anyone use cash anymore, whether it's to buy a **soda** or pack of cigarattes, people buy things with QR code and **facial recognition**"

In less than five years, Alipay has expaneded to become a **ubiquitous** app, **that touches** other parts of life.

Today AntGroup **composes** not just Alipay, but **a broader range of** financial services including mirco lending, insurance and one of the largest money market funds in the world, called YuEBao.

"So it's really flexiable **tool** that it gives the average Chinese consumers and small bussiness owners, who have long been ignored by the major banks, a taste of  what it's like to be able to invest and save money and to get **financing**, to **fund operations**."

"And all of these are done just **through** their smartphones almost **instantly**."

But the **rapid** growth of Ant has **drawn scrutiny** from banks the regulators as previously reported by the journal. 

Some Chinese banks were earlier concerned that Ant can take away their **deposits** and **reduce** how much cash people use.

Ant is trying to **shed its image as a disruptor** of China banking sector. 

This year the company dropped the word Financial Services from its name and order to reband itself as more of a tech company.

It also partners with many banks that **fund** the loans it makes and has made its money market fund less risky.

"Regulators especially the central bank, they are very concerned about the **potential liquidity**  risk, in one single fund on the YuEBao platform."

"The problem is, if **our** inverstors in this fund decide to draw the money at the same time, it could **cause** huge **liquidity** risk, and even damage the stability of China's financial system."

Ant respond quickly to regulators' concerns, by **imposing caps** on how much people could invest, and opening the platform to **rival** funds.

"Well, Ant may **have been a bit** reluctant to do that to some degree, its **cooperation** with the govermenet really is **crucial** becasue in China very few bussiness can succeed without blessings from the regulators."

Outside China Ant's attemps to expand has sometimes **gotten entangled** in politics.

In 2017, Ant tried to buy US money transfer company MoneyGram, but the deal was **scuttled** by US officals because of national security concerns.

"That was a really big **blow** to Ant's ambition to expand to US, which is a very large, and potentially **lucrative** market."

At this time, Ant's **dual** IPO with Alibaba will bypass New York. A person familiar with the company said Ant never intended to go public in US.

It has its eye on India and **Southeast Asia**, where consumers and businesses are **underbanked** similiar to those in China.

But Ant **plans aren't** to launch Alipay in those markets.

"Ant never intends to server consumers outside of China **via** Alipay directly. Their approach is to provide some tech or operational **expertise** in some mobile payment startups in those markets, but they don't really run **this** business in-house."

And since Ant has already captured the biggest market in the world, it's been **laying the groundwork** to follow the millions of Chinese **tourist** who go abroad every year.

The company has increased the partnerships with retailers and **restaurants** overseas, while the pandemic has **cyfled** much of travel this year, the company is not seeing a slowdown of online shopping and cashless payment in China.

The ant will make global **xx** in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and never remain a household name only in China.
