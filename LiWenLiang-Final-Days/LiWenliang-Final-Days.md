This **cemetery is the final resting place** of whistle-blower Li Wenliang.  He was a doctor in Wuhan China, and before he died of COVID **at age of thirty four**, he was one of first people in the world who sounded the alarm about the emerging SARS like virtus.  In the final weeks in his life, he became a**household name, and took on many roles**. victim of censorship, a patient, and to many, a hero.  More than two years after his death, Dr.Li remains a **galvanizing figure** in China, his Weibo page regularly receives hundreds of comments a week, and has became a place where people **pay tribute**, share personal stories.
A goverment investigation concluded Dr.Li's was death a tragedy and he should not have been **reprimanded** for speaking out, but more complete picture **of his** medical care and **his** treatment by the authorites has remained **elusive**.

To fill in some of those gaps, The Times has exlusively spoke to a **colleague** of Dr.Li, **who was on the front line of the COVID fight**. He asked to remain **anonymous**, we're **referring him only as** Dr.B.

He provided a first-hand **account** of desisions made during Dr.Li's final hours.

We also **obtained** internal memos from the hospital where Dr.Li worked as well as his medical daily progress **notes** and doctor's orders, verifed by multiple experts and matched up with public information from Chinese media.

We found no evidents that his medical cure was compromised, but these documents, along with Dr.B's account and expert analysis, reveal important new details about his illness and treatment.

Taken together, they show how Dr.Li spent his last thirty nine days, going up against a **deadly** virus, navigating goverment attempts to censor him.

"His greatest influence on me is what he once said:'a healthy society should not have just one voice'".

Li Wenliang never set out to be a whistle-blower, he was working as a ophthalmologist in Wuhan Central Hospital in late December two thousand nineteen.

When he started sharing information, he was hearing with friends in a private group chat. "The Huanan Seafood and Fruit Market has 7 confirmed SARS", said one message.

He also send photo of virus **sequencing** report, with the words "SARS-like coronavirtus". The screenshot of the this group chat **leaked** to **the** public. 

It immediately triggered concern, because mere mention of SARS reminded people of the deadly epidemic that **gripped** China in two thousand three.

Even the offical COVID case number grows, authorities tried to control the message **behind the scenes**. Dr.Li was one of the first targets. At this point, the public didn't know who he was.

On December thirty first, hospital officals made him wirte a **formal** apology for spreading rumors.

In the document, which we're making it public for the first time, He said he deeply regretted the negative impact he'd caused.

Several days later, local police made Dr.Li sign a statement, promising to never spread rumors again.

On that day, Wuhan health authorities **were** publicly insisting this new virus was not **known to transmit** between humans.

But physicians in the city were watching a very diffferent story unfold, including Dr.B, who was working at the front lines in Wuhan Central Hospital.

"One patient of ours was diagnosed as having a **lung** infection, the people who came to transfer this patient were all in those hazmat suits, the kind I've only seen in movies."

He was one of the first doctor in the world who ever treated COVID-19 patient. He asked to remain **anonymous**, becasue he fears reprisals from  Chinese goverment.

"Why is everyone so nervous about this patient?"

"Why does the hospital repeatedly tell us not to spread word about this?"

"They even asked us to not mention it to friends on Wechat"

Twelve days after Li Wenliang's messages leaked, authorities still insisted there was no evidence the virus was transmissible, they also claimed no medical workers had been infected, neither was true.

"When this news came out, a few doctors in my office were upset, saying how could there be no huamn trasmission? Entire families came to our emergency room with the same disease."

"At that time, some medical workers at Wuhan Central Hospital had already been infected."

One of those infected medical workers was Dr Li.

By January eleven, almost two weeks after messages **had been leaked**, he had a fever, and a CT scan showed multiple lung infections

On January twelve, he checked **into** Wuhan Central Hospital. Each day, hospitals in Wuhan **were seeing** more people **sick** with COVID, but the goverment reported no new cases for several days.

Internal memos from Wuhan Central Hospital obtained by the Times illustrated there was confusing process **in place for** hospital **staffers**.

**Approvals to report new cases was subject to shifting instructions**, from **district**-level, city-level, and provincial-level **bureaucracies**

Dr.Li's own case appeared to be getting worse, he was struggling physically but also mentally. 

The medical record we obtained showed that on January nineteen, **in addition to having severe pneumonia**, he was also diagnosed as being in a **depressive** state. 

We made exact **replicas** of the records, taking out details that can identify the source.

We also **redacted** some sections to preserve Dr.Li's privacy.

On January twenty, there was a turning point. For the first time, the goverment had acknowledged the virus was **indeed contagious**.

"It is definately contagious among humans. There is definitive evidence of this from Wuhan."

Wuhan hospitals soon became overwhelmed by the number of patients with COVID sympotoms.

"What on earth do you want to do?"

Soon after, the entire city of Wuhan **went into** a lockdown. As this was happening, Dr.Li had been transfered to intensive care.

From his hospital bed, he made a important desicion, to share story **with** the public.

He gave anonymous interview to Chinese newspaper as a Wuhan doctor who was **reprimanded** by authorities, **and said he had contracted COVID.**

Several days later, he **revealed** his name and identity on his Weibo account.

The **public finally got to**  know more about this mysterious doctor, and **wanted updates about his health**, they **saw him as a kind of folk hero,** and were angry about the way authories reprimaneded him.

In the following week, his condition didn't seem to improve.

"He was infected with an early variant of the virus, its course was life-threatening, and it developed very fast.""

In addition to Dr.Wu, the Times has shared Dr.Li's medical records with seven US-based Chinese medical experts, who used to practice medicine in China or have experience treating COVID patients in US.

All of them believed, there is no intentional **negligence** in Dr.Li treatment, and there was no evidence doctors were motivated by a **political agenda**.

"You get a sense, they were trying to do whatever they can, but nothing worked."

But the records and Dr.B's account gives us better insight **into** how he was treated, and raise questions about how authorities **communicated** the attemps to **resuscitate** him.

Twenty five days of his **hospitalization** on **February** fifth, Li Wenliang's condition **deteriorated**. In the afternoon, the doctor's order shows they did numbers of examinations to evaluate his lung and heart.

But the morning of February sixth, doctor wrote process notes that Li Wenliang's lung was severely damaged, and he was at high risk of multiple organ failure.

Most of our experts agreed that at this point, few things could have helped him, except to immidiately put him on **invasive ventilator**, to ease his breathing.

Since you've already tried a **non-invaside ventilator** the patiente couldn't tolerate and that you've already tried the high-flow **oxygen** for several days, it's time to consider intubation at that point.

But Dr.Li was intubated though we don't know why. Some doctors are reluctant to intubate young patients, sometimes the patients themselves refuse it.

There's no **consensus** on this day, on when the **invasive ventilator** should be used on COVID patients.

Dr.Li's health was about to take a turn for **the** worse, and **put public on edge**.

Around seven twenty P.M., the **night** of Feburary six, Dr.Li went into **cardiac arrest**, his medical team immediately started to perform CPR.

At that point, followed common practice and intubated him as part of **resuscitation**. 

Shortly after his resuscitation began, Dr.Li's medical team considered put him on a machine called ECMO.

Invasive life support system adds oxygen to blood has been used by some doctors as last **resort** severe COVID-19 patients.

**Through its effect is** still debated, at the beginning of the **pandemic**, Chinese media **portrayed** ECMO as a promising treatment, and much of the public were holding **out** hope that there would be a **miracle**.

Dr.B **arriveed** around nine P.M., about two hours of the resuscitation, and ECMO machine borrowed from another hospital was in the room, according to him, it was not in use.

At that point, Dr.B **said** doctors in intensive care **ward** thought using ECMO was meaningless, beacause Dr.Li was alraedy **clinically** dead.

"The normal process at this point would have been to pronounce him dead."

But he said hospital **administrators** asked medical team to use ECMO anyway, because they wanted to **signal to** the public they did everything possible to save Dr.Li.

"Someone took a call around this time, and told us we have to continue the resuscitation because hospital leaders said so."

"Both out of medical and ethical concerns, ECMO shouldn't be used at this point, it was just a rescue of a body"

"it was simply an act of buying time for our hospital administrators, putting him on ECMO at this point was actually an insult to his body."

The six physicans we spoke to agreed it would have been too late to use ECMO.

"I don't think that's gonna improve the **prognosis**, I don't think it's gonna do anything."

Dr.B left the room around midnight. He says ECMO had not been in use, because the **instrument** to perform the procedure was not available.

It's unclear whether **it was ultimately** used after he left. There is also no indication in doctor's orders for that night the procedure was ever administered.

But for some reason, the daily program notes say ECMO was used, it's the only **discrepancy of** this kind we found in the entire medical records.

The subsequent **goverment-led** investigation also concluded the precedure was performed.

As the rescue efforts continued, Dr.B knew, there was no hope.

"I think Dr.Li had already died by the time I saw him around 9 o'clock on February sixth."

**An echocardiogram** report from around nine ten P.M. on February sixth **corroborates** Dr.B's account, each showed his heart stopped beating.

Shortly after, a state-run publication called Life Times reported Dr.Li's time of death was nine thirty P.M. 

The hospital didn't announce Dr.Li's death for another few hours. They said he'd died at two fifty eight A.M.

Many online commenters **were upset that the death announcement came so late**, and so was Dr.B.

"The dragged their feet for so long over the annoucement, it's like hospital really did ont treat us as human beings." 

"I was just crying, I can't describe how I felt, it'was like something in me crumbled."

Li Wenliang's death **shook** the country. On Weibo **hashtags demanding freedom of speech started** treading **following** online reports of his death, they reached millions of views.

A few hours later, they had been removed by censors. 

To this day, the Chinese goverment is carefully managing conversations about Dr.Li online.

The granted him an honory **burial**, and named him a national hero, but often punish people for **commemorating** him as a victim of censorship.

In the two years **since** Dr.Li's death, the Chinese goverment has continued to **conceal** and revise history of its handling of the pandemic. 

The Times had learned the last year, at least three major hospital in Wuhan, including Wuhan Central Hospital, restricted doctor's access to COVID patient records **from the early days of the outbreak**

For Dr.B, going public with his version **of events** is an attemp to get **his story out** and honor Dr.Li's legacy.

"This will eventually disappear from public view, but I'll always believe, even if others forgot, I should leave the world with something."

The Times made several attempts to contact Dr.Li's medical team, but members agreed to answer questions.

Wuhan Central Hospital told The Times that it was no accepting interview requests from international media outlets at this times.
